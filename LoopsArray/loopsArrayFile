## Oh no! Someone has filled my list (which was supposed to collect the number of pets everyone had) with strings and decimal numbers. 
## Please fix this by removing all invalid inputs from the list (maybe find a way to use a loop for this, hint hint)
## Then order all remaining elements of the list least to greatest
## Finally, use a while loop to make sure that an input statement only accepts whole number integers
## Thank you coders
## - Person who didn't input validate

myList = [1, 3, 5.5, 69, 420, "Lol", "Who has pets?", "I am da one, da one...", 2, 5, 6, True, False, "12", 4, 8.8, 0.0000001, "What kinda loser doesn't input validate?", "hackz", 3]
